DarkSkyApi NuGet
An unofficial C# library for the Dark Sky weather service. Targets .NET Standard 1.1 - compatible with .NET 4.5, Mono 4.6, Windows 8/8.1, Windows Phone 8/8.1, .NET Core 1.0, Xamarin Android/iOS, and Universal Windows Apps.

Installation
NuGet: Install-Package DarkSkyApi

New in Version 3.3 (04 December 2017)
Full Changelog

Breaking Change: UVIndexTime is now a DateTimeOffset like other time fields; previously it was a double.
Added support for new fields (thanks, @MattLugar!).
Alert
Severity indicates the severity of the alert.
Time indicates the time at which the alert was issued.
Regions indicates the regions covered by the alert.
DayDataPoint
HighTemperature/HighTemperatureTime indicates the daytime high temperature, and when it occurs.
LowTemperature/LowTemperatureTime indicates the overnight low temperature, and when it occurs.
WindGust/WindGustTime indicates the wind gust speed, and when it occurs.
PrecipitationAccumulation indicates the amount of snowfall accumulation expected.
HourDataPoint
WindGust indicates the wind gust speed.
PrecipitationAccumulation indicates the amount of snowfall accumulation expected.
Mark deprecated fields as deprecated.
DayDataPoint
ApparentMaxTemperature/ApparentMaxTemperatureTime
ApparentMinTemperature/ApparentMinTemperatureTime
MaxTemperature/MaxTemperatureTime
MinTemperature/MinTemperatureTime
Quick Start
Current Conditions
using DarkSkyApi;
using DarkSkyApi.Models;

...

var client = new DarkSkyService("YOUR API KEY HERE");
Forecast result = await client.GetWeatherDataAsync(37.8267, -122.423);

...


Note that the Dark Sky service doesn't always return all fields for each region. In these cases, some properties may be null or zero.

Conditions for a specific date
using DarkSkyApi;
using DarkSkyApi.Models;

...

var client = new DarkSkyService("YOUR API KEY HERE");

Forecast result = await client.GetTimeMachineWeatherAsync(37.8267, -122.423, DateTimeOffset.Now);

...
The Helpers class contains extension methods to convert a DateTimeOffset to Unix time, and back:

int unixTime = DateTimeOffset.Now.ToUnixTime();

DateTimeOffset date = unixTime.ToDateTimeOffset();
API Usage Information
After making a request for data (be it current or historical), the DarkSkyService instance's ApiCallsMade property will contain the number of calls made today, using the given API key. The property will be null if no requests have been made through the particular instance.

Design
This library uses a client-oriented approach, instead of a request-response model: the DarkSkyService object is intended to be an abstraction from which weather data (Forecasts) can be obtained.

Forecasts do contain all the fields that can appear in the raw JSON obtained through making a direct request to the web service, but exposes them through more .NET convention-friendly properties: for example, precipIntensityMax is exposed as MaxPrecipitationIntensity. These properties are (as shown here) sometimes more verbose, but were intended to match the style commonly used in .NET projects.

Tests
NUnit is used for some simple integration tests with the actual web service. To run the tests, a valid API key must be added to the app.config file in the DarkSkyService.Test folder.
